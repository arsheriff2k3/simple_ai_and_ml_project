# Diabetes Prediction using Random Forest Classifier

This code aims to predict the presence or absence of diabetes using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm. It uses a dataset called 'diabetes.csv' containing various features related to diabetes. The goal is to train the classifier on a subset of the data and evaluate its performance.

## Libraries Used

- pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- numpy: Provides support for numerical operations in Python.
- matplotlib.pyplot: Enables data visualization and plotting of graphs.
- seaborn: Another library for data visualization, often used in conjunction with matplotlib.

    Explain the steps involved in the code. You can provide a high-level overview of each step and its significance. Here's an example:

## Code Explanation

1. Import the necessary libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn.
2. Read the dataset using the pandas 'read_csv' function.
3. Display the first five rows of the dataset using the 'head' function.
4. Check the shape of the dataset using the 'shape' attribute.
5. Get information about the dataset using the 'info' function.
6. Check for any missing values in the dataset using the 'isnull().sum()' function.
7. Split the dataset into features (x) and the target variable (y).
8. Split the data into training and testing sets using the 'train_test_split' function from sklearn.
9. Create a RandomForestClassifier model using sklearn's 'RandomForestClassifier' class.
10. Train the model using the training data.
11. Predict the output labels for the test data using the trained model.
12. Calculate the accuracy score of the model using the 'accuracy_score' function from sklearn.metrics.
13. Print the accuracy score.

    Conclude the readme by providing any additional details or instructions. For example, you can mention the version of the libraries used, any specific requirements or dependencies, and how to run the code. Here's an example:


## Conclusion

This code demonstrates the use of the Random Forest Classifier algorithm for diabetes prediction. By analyzing the given dataset, the code trains a model and evaluates its accuracy in predicting diabetes. The achieved accuracy score for this model is 0.74.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have all the required libraries installed.
2. Download the 'diabetes.csv' dataset and place it in the same directory as this code file.
3. Run the code in a Python environment such as Jupyter Notebook or any IDE of your choice.
4. The accuracy score of the model will be displayed as the output.

That's it in machine learning.


## Diabetes Prediction using Neural Networks

This repository contains code for training a neural network model to predict diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. The code is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.
Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is diabetesclean.csv. It contains 768 instances with 9 columns, including 8 features (inputs) and 1 target variable (label). The features represent different medical measurements, while the label indicates whether a person has diabetes or not.
Installation

To run the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

    TensorFlow (version 2.10.0 or higher)
    NumPy
    scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install tensorflow numpy scikit-learn

    Run the code:

python diabetes_prediction.py

This will train the neural network model using the dataset and display the loss and accuracy for each epoch.

    Adjusting the model:

Feel free to modify the architecture of the neural network by changing the number of layers, the number of units in each layer, and the activation functions. You can also experiment with different optimization algorithms and loss functions by modifying the model.compile() function.

    Evaluating the model:

After training, the model will be evaluated using the test dataset. The final accuracy of the model will be displayed.
