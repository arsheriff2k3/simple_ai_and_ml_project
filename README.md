# Diabetes Prediction using Random Forest Classifier

This code aims to predict the presence or absence of diabetes using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm. It uses a dataset called 'diabetes.csv' containing various features related to diabetes. The goal is to train the classifier on a subset of the data and evaluate its performance.

## Libraries Used

- pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- numpy: Provides support for numerical operations in Python.
- matplotlib.pyplot: Enables data visualization and plotting of graphs.
- seaborn: Another library for data visualization, often used in conjunction with matplotlib.

    Explain the steps involved in the code. You can provide a high-level overview of each step and its significance. Here's an example:

## Code Explanation

1. Import the necessary libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn.
2. Read the dataset using the pandas 'read_csv' function.
3. Display the first five rows of the dataset using the 'head' function.
4. Check the shape of the dataset using the 'shape' attribute.
5. Get information about the dataset using the 'info' function.
6. Check for any missing values in the dataset using the 'isnull().sum()' function.
7. Split the dataset into features (x) and the target variable (y).
8. Split the data into training and testing sets using the 'train_test_split' function from sklearn.
9. Create a RandomForestClassifier model using sklearn's 'RandomForestClassifier' class.
10. Train the model using the training data.
11. Predict the output labels for the test data using the trained model.
12. Calculate the accuracy score of the model using the 'accuracy_score' function from sklearn.metrics.
13. Print the accuracy score.

    Conclude the readme by providing any additional details or instructions. For example, you can mention the version of the libraries used, any specific requirements or dependencies, and how to run the code. Here's an example:


## Conclusion
